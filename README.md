# Blog_Post_Udacity_AirBnB_Seattle

This README is part of a project that I coduncted for the Data Science nanodegree of Udacity. 

## Libraries

   - python
   - pandas
   - numpy
   - matplotlib.pyplot
   - seaborn
   - calendar
   - datetime
   
## Motivation

The project focuses on understanding and applying the CRSIP-DM process as well writing a blog post on e. g. MEDIUM - which I used to write my first ever blog post. I was and is a very interesting project, which I truly enjoyed working on, because it allows for combining powerfull analysis using a jupyter notebook, setting up a GitHub repository and telling your story on a page like MEDIUM.

## Repository

My repository contains the files:

1. A jupyter notebook called "Seattle_AirBNB_Data.ipynb" which contains all the analysis conducted using the CRISP-DM process.
2. A Readme document summarizing the motivation, repositories used, results and acknowledgements.

## Results

My results can be viewed either in the jupyter notebook uploaded in this repository or in my MEDIUM blog post:

## Acknowledgements

The AirBnB data I used can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data. I would like to thank my data science colleagues for being patient and supporting whenever I got stuck with an analysis and also like to encourage my colleagues who are currently pursuing their own udacity nanodegrees to keep up the good spirit and enjoy the ride.
